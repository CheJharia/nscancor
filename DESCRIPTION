Title: Non-Negative and Sparse CCA
Description: This package implements an algorithm for canonical correlation
    analysis (CCA) that is based on iterated regression
    steps. By choosing the appropriate regression algorithm for each data
    modality, it is possible to enforce sparsity, non-negativity or other kinds
    of constraints on the projection vectors. Multiple components are computed
    sequentially using a generalized deflation scheme, where the additional
    correlation not explained by previous components is maximized for each
    component. 'nscancor' has the same interface as the 'cancor' function from
    the 'stats' package (plus some extra parameters).
